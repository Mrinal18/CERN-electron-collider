# CERN-electron-collider
This is in collaboration with CERN: 
To explore what our universe is made of, we are colliding protons, essentially recreating mini big bangs, and meticulously observing these collisions with intricate silicon detectors.

While orchestrating the collisions and observations is already a massive scientific accomplishment, analyzing the enormous amounts of data produced from the experiments is becoming an overwhelming challenge.

Event rates have already reached hundreds of millions of collisions per second, meaning physicists must sift through tens of petabytes of data per year. And, as the resolution of detectors improve, ever better software is needed for real-time pre-processing and filtering of the most promising events, producing even more data
